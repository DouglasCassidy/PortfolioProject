  To Whom It May Concern,<br><br>
  I am interested in obtaining a position within your organization. I have established good work ethics during my
  time at Fresh Co and while volunteering at Jack Minersâ€™, the Community Food Sharing program, and programs within
  the school board. This experience has taught me to work as a team, be independent and prioritize tasks.
  I am looking to continue to grow my skills in the workforce and gain meaningful employment. I hope to continue
  working on the skills I currently have, while developing new ones. I feel that I would make a great asset to your
  team with my dedication and attention to detail. I am a reliable and dependable worker. I look forward to hearing
  from you to further discuss any employment opportunities you may currently have.<br><br><br>

  Respectfully,<br><br>
